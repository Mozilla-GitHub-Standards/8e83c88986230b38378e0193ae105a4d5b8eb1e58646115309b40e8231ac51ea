# WELCOME!

This repository was started as a place to plan, document, and share research around reuse of research data.

### Why does this repository exist?

Stephanie Wykstra & Steph Wright first collaborated together in 2016 to gather cases of research data re-use to try and understand what made those particular data sets useful in an attempt to further encourage more data reuse.

You can read:
* our [invitation](https://science.mozilla.org/blog/share-your-story) to colleagues to share their stories
* the [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKlrJRG8lm80DYAlavd4S5hzcO2StIki3i-4MnwsfnEMQRCQ/viewform), and
* our [blog post about the results](https://science.mozilla.org/blog/sharing-our-story-of-research-data-reuse).

We weren't able to really answer our questions with the few case studies we received.  Recently Stephanie Wykstra was working on an unrelated project and discovered the Robert Wood Johnson had an archive with ICPSR, as do many other funders. ICPSR does a great job of generating a list of papers which have used the data stored in their repository.  Stephanie thought that perhaps we could use this list to pull out information such as:
* number of papers published using data from these studies, 
* the extent to which papers are published by one or more original researchers versus other researchers using their data,
* and some other quetions to get more information about how data is (or isn't) being reused.

This repository is here as a central place to collect information, plan and collaborate around this idea and any others that crop up around research data reuse.
